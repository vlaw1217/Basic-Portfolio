        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <h2> I want to be a web developer.</h2>

    <p> I am originally from Hong Kong. I have lived in Toronto for about 15 years. For my past seven years, I was
        working at
        Cathay Pacific Airways as a customer service office. My job was mostly at the counter doing check-in procedure
        and
        ticketing issues.
    </p>



    <p> I want to change my job because I foresee this kind of job would not be last long in the next ten years.
        Everything is
        self could do, self check-in at kiosk, self bag drop and even the ticketing problems. People could do it online
        by
        themselves nowadays.</p>



    <p>Another reason I want to change my job because I love animals more than human. I used to interact different kind
        of
        people in my job. I would say I see a lot of "human ugliness". Communicate with animals or would be more
        comfortable for
        me. At least, I could act to be myself. Thats why I hope to find another job that it maybe has sustainable
        development
        and
        I am also interested in. Finally, I found it â€” its a web developer.</p>

    <p> Because of my recent job, I had many chances to visit a lot of countries. Especially last year, after my parent
        were taken by
        cancers within two years. It struck me heavily and I lost myself. Luckily, my husband is always by my side. He
        accompanied me to travel Australia, China, and Argentina in last year. I did a lot of fun things that I have
        never dream
        of. I did sky diving in Australia. I walked the great wall in Beijing and it was my first time visiting South
        America. </p>

    <p> I love creative and willing to try new things. Challenging is my favourite. Therefore, I quitted my job and
        attend the
        coding boot camp in UofT. I am completely new about it and sometimes feel overwhelming but it is fun and
        interesting. I
        put over 10 hours for practicing everyday because I hope it would be filled up my lacking. I know it will take
        time but
        I feel confident and I hope I would have opportunities to try it out.
